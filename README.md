University of California, Santa Barbara: PSTAT 135/235, winter quarter 2019

### Explanation
- Part 1: Webscraping of cars for sale in Sk√•ne, Sweden from private sellers. Scraping is done from Swedish buy and sell site https://www.blocket.se/ using BeautifulSoup.
- Part 2: Data preprocessing done using pySpark since I wanted to practice and was not necessary for a data set containing about 2500 rows (scraping done on Jan 26 2019). Visualizations are done using pandas and matplotlib.

#### Note: 
Formating of the webpage where the scraping was done could change if this is read at a later time.
